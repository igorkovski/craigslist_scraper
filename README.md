CRAIGSLIST SCRAPER

This is a scraper that I built while going through the BaseRails.com Tutorial using 3taps API which gathers apartment data in Brooklyn, NY.

It is deployed to Heroku and you can go visit the app here:

Here are a few things that I learned while going through this course:

	• How to work with the 3taps API & JSON files
	•	How to build a rake task that parses new data while deleting old data
	•	Importing Bootstrap 3 styling
	•	Use partials to clean up the code 
	•	Adding Data Filters
	•	Deplying to Heroku and Automating the rake task using Heroku Scheduler
